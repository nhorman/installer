Windows installer script
========================

Overview
--------

The windows installer script found in this directory is capable of building a
windows installer executable capable of installing both 32 and 64 bit openssl
binaries, along with their corresponding development headers

Requirements
------------

* [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page) version 3.0.8 or later
* Windows 2022 or later
* The Windows SDK
  - The makecert.exe utility (to demonstrate installer signing)
  - The Pvk2Pfx.exe utility (to demonstrate installer signing)
  - The SignTool.exe utility (to demonstrate installer signing)

Notes on Signing
----------------

Installer signing is demonstrated here using self signed certificates. Do not
use this signed code in a deployment as the generated certificate should not be
trusted.  However, if you wish to observe this signed installer in operation,
the generated certificate may be imported to the local trust store following the
instructions
[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/appxpkg/how-to-create-a-package-signing-certificate).
at your own risk.

Installer Build Prerequisites
-----------------------------

1) Build Openssl from the parent of this directory:
    a) cd /path/to/openssl/source/root
    b) mkdir \_build64
    c) cd \_build64
    d) perl ..\Configure [options] VC-WIN64A
    e) nmake
    f) repeat steps a-e substituting \_build32 for \_build64 to build VC-WIN32

Building the installer
----------------------

From the windows-installer directory, the included makefile can build 2 targets
1) openssl-installer
2) signed-openssl-installer

If option 1 is selected, the openssl-testversion-installer.exe file will be
generated, pulling needed binaries from the ../\_build32 and ../\_build64
directories.

If option 2 is selected, A self signed certificate will be generated and used to
create the same installer, and digitally sign it.  Note that the Signtool
utility requires a password for the generated private key be passed on the
command line, while the MakeCert utility requires that it be entered via a gui
popup window.  As such the Makefile is hard coded to use the password
'testpass', which must be entered when prompted during certificate generation, or
the signing process will fail.

Installer build options
-----------------------

* /DBUILD64
  - Optional
  - Path to the fully qualified 64 bit build directory (ex c:\path\to\openssl\_build64)

* /DBUILD32
  - Optional
  - Path to the fully qualified 32 bit build direcotry (ex c:\path\to\openssl\_build32)

* /DLICENSE\_FILE
  - Required
  - Path to the openssl LICENSE.TXT file

* /DVERSION
  - Required
  - Version number to insert in the openssl installer file name and meta data
  - Should match the version of openssl being built

* /DSIGN
  - Optional
  - Path to the fully qualified location of the code signing certificate pfx file

* /DSIGNPASS
  - Required if /DSIGN is provided
  - Password strign to decrypt the pfx file
